# TMFS (Tamer's Minimal File System)
This is a part of a minimal filesystem that I am working on. I built it to implement the theoretical knowledge I had acquired in my study of operating systems.

The project represents a Disk emulator, and a part of a filesystem(The features supported by the filesystem are provided in the TMFS-DOCUMENTATIOM file).

The C libraries used in this project are built in to Windows, BSD, and most Linux distributions.

The only requirement to be able to run it is to have GCC installed on your system.

# Execution:
  1- Formatting the disk:
      . You enter "util" directory and execute the file in 			it. It will then provide you with how you must 				address the command depending on ceratin condition.
        eg: ./osutil format c
		IMPORTANT NOTE: I only provided a wrapper function 			for formatting, but not for anything else.
  2- Printing information about the disk:
      . 
  3-  Return information about a file:
      . 
	4-  Mounting the filesystem:
      .
	5-  Unmounting the filesystem:
      .
	6-  Creating i-nodes:
      .
	7-  Finding i-nodes:
      .
	8-  Allocating i-nodes:
      .
	9-  Unallocating i-nodes:
      .
	10- Saving an i-node:
      .
	11-  Making a bitmap:
      .


Thank you for your time and care :)
