# TMFS (Tamer's Minimal File System)
This is a part of a minimal filesystem that I am working on.
I built it to implement the theoretical knowledge I had acquired
in my study of operating systems.

The project represents a Disk emulator, and a part of a filesystem
(The features supported by the filesystem are provided in the TMFS-DOCUMENTATIOM file).

The C libraries used in this project are built in to Windows, BSD, and most Linux distributions.

# Requirements

. Have GCC installed on your system.

. A disk emulator that satisfies the needs of the filesystem 
(Tne one provided with the project is called "TMDE", you can
modify it based on your needs or provide one that has the same
structure).

# Execution:
All the functions are executed in the "execution" directory. And the 
user only has to write the function calls of the features he/she would like to 
experiment(with the required parameters) in "command.c", and then call "make" 
followed by "./command.com" in the terminal.

# Thanks
Thank you for your time and care :)
