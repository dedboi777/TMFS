# TMFS (Tamer's Minimal File System)
This is a part of a minimal filesystem that I am working on. I built it to implement the theoretical knowledge I had acquired in my study of operating systems.

The project represents a Disk emulator, and a part of a filesystem(The features supported by the filesystem are provided in the TMFS-DOCUMENTATIOM file).

The C libraries used in this project are built in to Windows, BSD, and most Linux distributions.

The only requirement to be able to run it is to have GCC installed on your system.


Thank you for your time and care :)
