# TMFS
This is a part of a minimal filesystem that I am working on. I built it to implement the theoretical knowledge I had acquired in my study of operating systems.


The project represents a Disk emulator, and a part of a filesystem(The features supported by the filesystem are provided in the TMFS-DOCUMENTATIOM file)



Thank you for your time and care :)
