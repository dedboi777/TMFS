# TMFS
This is a part of a minimal filesystem that I am working on. I built it to implement the theoretical knowledge I had acquired in my study of operating systems.


The project represents a Disk emulator, and a part of a filesystem(The features supported by the filesystem are provided in the TMFS-DOCUMENTATIOM file).

The C libraries uesed in this project are built in to Windows, BSD, and most Linux distributions.


Thank you for your time, and care :)
